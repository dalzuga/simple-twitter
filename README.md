This is a re-write of a team project during my time at Holberton School.

A project like this needs special care and attention, and I felt like the school curriculum did not allow for enough hours to be dedicated to it. The goal of this re-write is to strengthen my understanding of higher-level languages, and to better understand how to build a high-quality front end.
