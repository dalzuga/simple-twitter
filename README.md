This is a re-write of a team project during my time at Holberton School.

A project like this needs special care and attention, and I felt like the school curriculum did not allow for enough hours to be dedicated to it. I did this to strengthen my understanding of higher-level languages, and to understand how to build a front-end that is clean, simple, and with the correct level of engineering.
